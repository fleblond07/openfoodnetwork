# Reports framework

A framework that handles querying and rendering tabular data.

TODO: add more details on how each part works.

## Rules
Rules are used for grouping, ordering, and summary rows. Options are documented at [`Reporting::ReportTemplate#rules`](
https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/blob/master/lib/reporting/report_template.rb#L68-L95).
