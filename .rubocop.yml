  # The automatically generated todo list to ignore all current violations.
  - .rubocop_todo.yml

  # The relaxed style rules as a common starting point which we can refine.
  - .rubocop_relaxed_styleguide.yml

  # Our Open Food Network style guides. If you want to see all violations,
  # then use only that configuration:
  #
  #     bundle exec rubocop -c .rubocop_styleguide.yml
