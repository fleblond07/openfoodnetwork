<%# Override Devise partial

While this partial is unused in our app, Devise still renders it during
password reset and it fails to find `omniauth_authorize_path` which tries
to call `spree_user_openid_connect_omniauth_authorize_path` on our main app
while that helper is only defined on `Spree::Core::Engine.routes.url_helpers`.

This is just a workaround and the proper solution would be to include all Spree
routes in our main Rails app instead of having a separate Spree::Core engine.
